# Introduction

Nearly all sciences in the world is dependent on mathematics. Then, the need to easier methods to do mathematics continues to be one of the most required things nowadays and will still be obtainable until the end of the world. 
In C++, there are some libraries that function on mathematics such as math.h and c math, but these libraries don't give you all the operations you need, however, they are the basis which we build our implementation on.
